# A Deep Reinforcement Algorithm in an OpenAI Gym Environment

During this project, we will build a deep neural network and use reinforcement learning to solve a cart and pole balancing problem using OpenAI. OpenAI Gym is a tookit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms that was built by OpenAI, a non-profit artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman.

This downloads the bare minimums for the OpenAI Gym environment. OpenAI Gym contains a wide variety of environments, even Atari games. Some of these environments will need additional dependencies installed.

We will also need the following python libraries:

NumPy

Keras

Theano
